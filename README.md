## PMM Demo - Infrastructure as Code

This repository is an IaC that covers our infrastructure needs for the following:

- building a environment to [demo PMM](pmmdemo/README.md)
- create several MySQL, PostgreSQL, Valkey, and Mongo servers in various configurations
- run benchmarks to generate load to populate PMM graphs

Please use [Percona's JIRA](https://jira.percona.com/jira/software/c/projects/PMMD/issues) to submit bugs, and feature requests.
